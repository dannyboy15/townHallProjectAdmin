##Current features: 
- Back end: bin/event.js runs every hour on heroku, it reads the google doc and writes to the firebase using the admin signin
- Front end: view for researchers to see what events current have issues

##Future:
- Back end: may be where our email automation lives.
- Front end: enter and edit new events. 
 * Levels of auth determines if an event gets put in "pending approval" or main database.
